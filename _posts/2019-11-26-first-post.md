title: Health aspects of meat alternatives - What drives consumer minds?
---

The study is demonstrating the ongoing results of the 1st part of an evolving 8 part proprietary ground breaking market research study using AI Psychophysics Mind Genomics into what excites or does not excite consumers emotionally in the emerging meat free “meat” market in the US as the first part of a proposed 6 / 8? country global study
Already results have shown big surprises and pitfalls  in the 1st area researched of health and show how consumer values and beliefs differ by their emotional Mindset’s enabling us to know the mind of specific consumers.
For example, overall meat free is seen as offering potential benefits in weight loss as opposed to contributing as part of a healthier lifestyle. 
However, within these findings there are two significant consumer behavior segments who have widely differing Mindsets For example one Mindset is interested in specific areas of health such as avoiding the risk of various diseases, the other in nutrients. 
Additionally, there are other key areas demonstrating the differing values of changing consumer behavior.
We are seeing the rapidly changing demands of consumer beliefs, values and behavior driven by emotionally driven Mindsets – not just what they say but using our proprietary research technology, to understand what they think and do and importantly, WHY?
