---

The results of the 1st part of a six part proprietary ground breaking market research study using Mind Genomics psychophysics 
into what excites or does not excite consumers emotionally in the emerging meat free "meat" market in the US focussed on the perceived healthiness of meat alternatives. 
The sutdy was competed by 100 respondents from California and New York in November 2019.

*Lowering rate of Diseases*

There is strong disagreement and negativity overall that meat free products will reduce the level of disease across all sectors, particularly amongst men in both New York and California  and 18-24 yo in California 
Females in New York are more positive, specifically in providing more energy and lowering the rate of diabetes unlike their counterparts in California 

*Weight Loss*

This has a more mixed response with men in New York more positive that meat free products would help to lose weight unlike men in California and women in New York 
In addition, there was not a great deal of enthusiasm for the idea that it would help with exercise but still no major positives amongst any group apart from 18-24 yo in New York who thought that it would benefit exercise and that lower fat help with weight loss

*Healthier Lifestyle*

There was no agreement that meat-free is part of a healthier lifestyle. However, there was more agreement that it fits in with an exercise regime particularly amongst New York males and 18-24 yo Californians and 25- 34 yo New Yorkers. 
There was also agreement amongst these New York males and 18-24 yo Californians that non meat eaters are healthier than meat eaters. In addition, females in California disagreed that non meat eaters show no difference from meat eaters in lifestyle while 18-24 yo in New York strongly agreed

*Nutrients*

Males and 18-24 yo in California also strongly disagreed with non meat are rich in vitamins and minerals while most other sectors showed little enthusiasm
However, these same males in California also disagreed that meat free products lack essential nutrients such as iron and nutrients although overall there was some low level agreement with this idea across other areas

*Mindsets*

Across both Mindsets there is both a polarization and some agreement across linking meat free and health issues 

*Mindset 1*

There is general disagreement that meat free helps in a healthier lifestyle with those in California particularly disagreeing that non meat eaters enjoy a healthier lifestyle
Overall in New York there is strong negativity towards linking meat free with better nutrients particularly fiber while California do believe that milk and eggs should not be discarded and that meat free does lack essential nutrients 

*Mindset 2* 

In this Mindset, New York agrees with California in Mindset 1 that meat free will not lower diseases and other areas such as reducing diabetes. While California disagrees apart from agreeing that children should not have a 100% meat free diet 
New York is more supportive of the link between weight loss and a meat free diet particularly that lower fat helps in a diet while California disagrees strongly with this and that high calorie meat substitutes hinder weight loss. In addition, New York is more supportive of the link to a healthier lifestyle particularly that consuming no meat fits in with exercise and that non- meat eaters are healthier than meat eaters, while California disagrees that there is no difference in lifestyle between meat eaters and non-meat eaters
Regarding nutrients, California is strongly negative towards meat free increases fiber intake and that it is rich in minerals and nutrients, they are also is negative towards discarding eggs and milk plus negativity that meat free is a rich source of nutrients such as iron and calcium.
