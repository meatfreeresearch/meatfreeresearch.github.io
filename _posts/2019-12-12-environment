title: Environmental aspects of meat alternatives - What drives consumer minds when it comes to the environment?
---

The results of the 2nd part of an eight part proprietary ground breaking market research study using Mind Genomics psychophysics 
into what excites or does not excite consumers emotionally in the emerging meat free "meat" market in the US focussed on the perceived 
impact on the Environment of consuming “Non-Meat” Meat vs. regular meat

*Overall top line on the Environment is that:*
...1. There is a clear differentiation of Mindsets between this who link the consumption of meat to environmental problems and those who do 
not and this largely determines all their detailed responses and result to the questions we asked
...2. Those who do care are more likely to be female and younger vs male and older

Such was the polarization of the differing Mindsets that it revealed majorly differing attitudes to both the concept of Meat Free and 
concerns (or not) about the Environment
