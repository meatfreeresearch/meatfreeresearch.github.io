title: What food products are accepted as meat-free?
---
The results of the 5th part of a six part proprietary ground breaking market research study using Mind Genomics psychophysics 
into what excites or does not excite consumers emotionally in the emerging meat free "meat" market in the US focussed on the 
acceptance of different food types containing *“Non-Meat”* vs. regular meat. 
The sutdy was competed by 100 respondents from California and New York in January 2020.

*Types*
For processed meat types like burgers or sausages there was no strong negatives or positives amongst any groups , either in New York or California. 
However, for steak like slices there was more positivity from females in New York but their counterparts in California were negative to this idea 
as were 18-24 yo in New York. There seemed uncertainty and no strong views if the meat free products were presented in pasta or noodle dishes with 
only 18-24 yo in California being strongly negatives. The same applied to inclusion in pastry or bread such as pies and sandwiches with only females 
in California expressing some positivity – the remaining groups were mixed and uncertain.

*Meat Types*
In these different types cultured meat seemed the most neutral with neither strong positives nor negatives. Plant based meat types gained strong 
approval amongst males in New York , females in California and 18-24 yo in both New York and California and seemed the most positive meat type. 
Unlike Insect based products which were treated with suspicion and negativity by males in California and females in New York as well as 25-34 yo 
in New York Generally this type received the least enthusiasm amongst all categories. Algae based types also gained minimal enthusiasm except 
amongst 18-24 yo in both New York and California.

*Where to Consume* 
There was a large amount of negativity as so where exactly meat free products would be consumed. Fast food outlets had the least amount of 
negativity except amongst New York women There was more negativity towards eating in the home from New York women plus 18-24 yo in California and 
25-34 yo in New York. Women in both New York and California were negative towards eating in restaurants as were 18-24 yo in California. Females again 
in New York were negative towards eating meat free at a business lunch as were 25 – 35 yo in New York However, 18-24 yo in California were very 
positive.

*Price*
Across the question of price there seems little positive reaction no matter what the price is set at There were no major positive indications 
towards having a slightly higher price than traditional meat only major negatives particularly from males in both New York and California and 
females and 25-34yo in California. Even at a slightly lower price there were little positives and  major negatives amongst males in New York and 
18-24yo in New York as was having the same price amongst the same respondents plus 25-34yo in California Even a lower price got largely negative 
reactions plus major negatives again from males and 18-24 yo in New York.

*Mindsets*
There were significant polarizing positives and negatives towards the food types even amongst the each of the Mindsets.

*Mindset 1*
There were strong positives towards the different types in California particularly towards steak like sliced meat. In meat types there were strong 
negatives towards insects in both California and New York and also towards algae  as a source in New York. In consuming in different eating locations 
there were strong negatives towards all locations in New York with a more neutral reaction in New York. All the different price points had major 
negatives in California whereas in New York there was a generally positive to neutral reaction with respondents happy to pay even slightly more.

*Mindset 2*
In California there were strong negative reactions towards sliced steak like meat and in pasta Other types had a neutral reaction in both New York 
and California. Overall plant based received the strongest positives In New York with other “meat” types receiving lower approval in both New York 
and California. New York was also positive about all consumption locations whereas California was more negative. All price points were also negative 
in New York except slightly higher price whereas California was very positive over a slightly lower price than traditional meat but was neutral  
regarding the other price points.
