title: Sensory aspects of meat alternatives - What drives consumers' minds?
---
The results of the 4th part of a six part proprietary ground breaking market research study using Mind Genomics psychophysics 
into what excites or does not excite consumers emotionally in the emerging meat free "meat" market in the US focussed on the 
sensory aspects of *“Non-Meat”* vs. regular meat. 
The sutdy was competed by 100 respondents from California and New York in January 2020.

*Appearance*
Overall respondents were generally pretty positive about the expected appearance of meat free substitutes particularly in New York which 
was generally more positive than California and the overall trend was differences to conventional meat in appearance is acceptable with only 
women and 25 – 34 yo in California being particularly negative.

*Aroma*
Again, expectations were generally positive around slight aroma, the same as normal meat or none. However, there was little enthusiasm for a 
strong distinct aroma. Males in both New York and California were both positive on aroma dimensions as 25-34 yo but 35- 44 less so in New York.

*Texture*
This has fewer positive expectations particularly amongst Californian males and 18-24 yo whether soft and juicy or firm and dry texture. California 
females, however, were more positive about the anticipated texture being similar to mince and being soft and juicy. Overall these two latter textures 
were the preferred option for most groups apart form those mentioned above.

*Taste*
An area where there is a notable lack of enthusiasm with negative expectations amongst New York Females and 35- 44 yo in both New York and California. 
This negativity was stronger if meat free products have major taste differences to meat. Directionally there was less negativity if the product tasted 
the same or similar to meat but not great enthusiasm. If the product has vegetable like flavor notes this had appeal amongst 35- 44yo in New York 
but not in California in the same age range.

*Mindsets*
Like most of this research we see 2 distinct Mindsets who are either positive or negative and this has little to do with age or demographics.

*Mindset 1* is enthusiastic about all aspects of appearance in both New York and California particularly New York who were keen on visible meat 
like chunks. Aroma has less positivity on all aspects with only California expressing a strong desire for no aroma. Texture has the strongest 
polarizing views in this same Mindset with New York keen on being similar to ground meat with a firm and dry texture while California is negative 
on these two same dimensions. Taste has less polarization but with not a lot of enthusiasm apart from major differences in taste being wanted in 
California. 

In *Mindset 2*, there is a lot more negativity being expressed. In Appearance this is strongly across all the dimensions in California at a similar 
negative value while less so in New York but still with negative expectations. Aroma expectations are more positive with the idea of being similar to 
normal meat or with a slight but normal aroma being appreciated in New York with California lower but still positive. Texture evoked the strongest 
negatives in this Mindset in New York across all dimensions  with only sliced meat texture being the best of a negative set while California liked 
the idea of ground meat texture and were quite positive about the rest of the texture variations. In Taste terms being exactly like meat or having 
vegetable flavors was appreciated in both New York and California but not having differences to meat, either major or slight.
