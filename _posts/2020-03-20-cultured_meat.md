title: Consumers' attitides towards cultured meat 
---

The results of the last of the six-part proprietary ground breaking market research study using Mind Genomics psychophysics 
into what excites or does not excite consumers emotionally in the emerging meat free "meat" market in the US focussed on the attitudes towards cultured meat products. 
The sutdy was competed by 100 respondents from California and New York in February 2020.

*Sustainability*

There is a level of uncertainty as to whether cultured meat is sustainable or not. Females in California who do not think it sustainable plus males in California directionally agree and do not think it less sustainable than meat. While 18-24 yo in California think it less sustainable while their 25-34 yo counterparts strongly disagree
Most think cultured meat is safe although females in California disagree as do 25-34 yo also in California
What is clear is that certain segments strongly disagree that cultured meat will reduce animal cruelty These are males in California and 25-34 yo in both New York and California, while 18-21 yo in California strongly agree 

*Ingredients*

Males in California are suspicious of cultured meat ingredients while males and 18-24 yo in New York strongly disagree. These same 18-24yo also disagree that such products are full of artificial ingredients while their counterparts in California do think it full of artificial ingredients as do males in New York and 25-34 yo in New York 
Directionally most feel that the ingredients would be healthier than real meat but do not agree significantly Also most agree that it would be produced with the latest advanced technology particularly males and 18-24 yo in California 

*Sensory* 

Males and 18-24 yo in New York supported the idea that cultured meat should taste the same as regular meat These same NY males also supported that it was OK if it tasted a bit differently  while 25-34 yo in California strongly opposed the idea 
However, there was no clear indication that it would taste or not taste like premium meat apart from Californian women who disagreed with the idea that it would not taste like premium meat in the future 
These same Californian women also felt that they would be able to tell the difference in the future as did New York women while their male counterparts disagreed and thought you would not be able to tell the difference vs real meat

*Possible Products*

This area raised some interesting results and differences as to peopleâ€™s preference for the type of product best suited to cultured meat 
Males in New York were strongly opposed to the idea of ground meat in sauces as were 18-24 yo in California while their  18-24 yo contempories in New York approved of the idea as did females in California
Californian males , 18-24 and 25- 34 yo were opposed to the concept of meat like slices or hamburger patties Those in New York were more indifferent 
There were no strong positives or negatives expressed towards bigger pieces added to soups and stews
