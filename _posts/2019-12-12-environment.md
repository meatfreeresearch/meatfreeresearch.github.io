title: Environmental aspects of meat alternatives - What drives consumer minds when it comes to the environment?
---

The results of the 2nd part of a six part proprietary ground breaking market research study using Mind Genomics psychophysics 
into what excites or does not excite consumers emotionally in the emerging meat free "meat" market in the US focussed on the 
perceived impact on the Environment of consuming *“Non-Meat”* vs. regular meat. 
The sutdy was competed by 100 respondents from California and New York in December 2019.

*Overall* 

There seems to both strong polarization and some uncertainty about the impact of meat free products on the environment.
There are those who are strongly concerned about the planet and the environment and those who equally strongly disagree. 
Then there are those who do not feel strongly either way and this reflects a level of uncertainty or even confusion in some of their responses.

*Climate change*

Males in both New York and California strongly disagree that meat free will help decrease greenhouse gases and that meat is one of the major causes of climate change. However, females in California strongly agree with both statements Although, some males in both areas also disagree that meat has little or no effect and that it is not the main cause of climate change even if it contributes
18-24 yo in New York and 25-34 yo in California also agree that meat production although contributing is not the main cause of climate change.

*Local Benefits*

Males in California could see very little local benefits in meat free towards local producers or the local environment However, They also disagreed that locally produced meat is better that meat substitutes and that local producers would lose their living as did 18-24 yo in New York  who also disagreed that meat free would benefit the local environment
Females in California agreed that the local environment would benefit and that local producers would lose their living  as do 25-34yo in New York who also thought that locally produced meat is better

*Land / Energy*

There seemed a large degree of uncertainty as to the effects of consuming meat free on land and energy with mixed results across the board with only 18-24 yo in New York strongly agreeing that meat demand contributes to biodiversity loss but also that with proper regulation meat production would have no effect

*Values*

Overall this got a lot stronger positive response as in total California agreed that meat free is less harmful to animals and New York agreed that it was better for the conscience 
While 18-24 yo strongly agreed that meat free was not cruel to animals while 25-34 yo New Yorkers disagreed
Females in California strongly agreed that it was less harmful to the planet as did 18-24 yo in both New York and California while 25-34 yo New Yorkers disagreed . Females in California and 18-24yo in New York also agreed strongly that meat free was better for their conscience but also agreed that humans are carnivores and need meat


*Mindsets*

Again, these Mindsets show strong polarization of views but also general uncertainty on answering some of the dimensions researched

*Mindset 1*

On climate change there is very strong disagreement across all the statements including both that meat free reduces greenhouse gases  and that meat production is one of the major causes of climate change AND disagreeing that meat production has little or no effect and that it is not the main cause of climate change

However, New York diverges on local benefits from California in that New York strongly supports all aspects including that meat substitutes can be produced by local farmers and that the local environment will be saved but that local meat is better and that local farmers could lose their living. California has no strong views but does have them on land and energy agreeing strongly on meat free reducing deforestation, not harming animals and that increased meat demand contributes to significant biodiversity loss 
The only other strong viewpoint is that meat free is better for the conscience in New York

*Mindset 2* 

Again, we see both polarization and uncertainty (mixed views / confusion?)  within this Mindset
Views on the impact of climate change are positive particularly in California on meat free helping to decrease greenhouse gases and that meat is one of the major causes of climate change BUT that meat production has no impact on climate change which New York agrees with as with meat production is not the main cause of climate change 

New York strongly disagrees with local benefits for local farmers and local environment as well as disagreeing with locally produced meat is better and that local producers would lose their living through meat free. California has mixed to neutral views for these responses
California has stronger views on disagreeing with meat substitutes requiring less deforestation and that increased meat demand results in significant biodiversity loss. New York is more positive but not strongly
However, New York has strong negative views on value aspects particularly that meat free is not cruel to animals and is less harmful to the planet. New York has the strong opposite view that meat substitutes are less harmful to the planet but also agrees strongly that humans are carnivores and need meat
