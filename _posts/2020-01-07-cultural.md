title: Cultural and social aspects of meat alternatives
---
The results of the 3rd part of a six part proprietary ground breaking market research study using Mind Genomics psychophysics 
into what excites or does not excite consumers emotionally in the emerging meat free "meat" market in the US focussed on the 
cultural and social aspects of *“Non-Meat”* vs. regular meat. 
The sutdy was competed by 100 respondents from California and New York in January 2020.

*Overall*
There seemed to be a general level of uncertainty and mixed responses in this area with not the general level of polarization that 
occurs in the other meat free areas being researched.

*Culture*
Males in New York strongly agree that meat alternatives are not part of their culture while males in California strongly disagree. 
There were no strong views on meat free products being popular in those countries only in need of protein. While only 18-24 in California
agreed that meat alternatives will eventually be part of the diet . Males in New York agree that meat free will eventually bring cultural 
benefits along with fellow New Yorkers 18-24 yo. Females in California disagreed.

*Local Traditions*
Many disagreed that meat free fitted in with local traditions particularly females in New York and California along with 18-24 yo in both areas. 
Males in New York agreed with the idea of local food produced with meat alternatives unlike 18-24yo in California . Males in New York agreed that 
local farmers would lose their jobs unlike females and 18-24 yo in California. Males  and 18-24 yo in New York also agreed with the idea of locally 
produced meat alternatives.

*Religion* 
There was some degree of polarization in this area. Most disagreed with the idea that meat eating is part of history, particularly females in 
New York In addition most disagreed that meat eating is not about killing animals but about living a healthy lifestyle Males in New York and 25-44 
yo in California did agree that traditions should be changed to save the planet with only New York females strongly disagreeing. 

*Is it the future?*
There seems to be a great deal of uncertainty as to this and associated areas, for example as to whether meat free alternatives are the future 
with only 25-44 agreeing that it will be. There were no other strong positive or negative reaction. The same applied as to whether meat alternatives 
will never be accepted, whether its only hype or if it might have a place in the market. Respondents in general seemed uncertain with no strong 
viewpoint.

*Mindsets*
Despite this whole culture and tradition area getting a mixed and uncertain response there were, however, some strong polarizing views in different 
Mindsets.

*Mindset 1* 
New York was mainly strongly negative towards aspects of religion and meat being part of our history, as was California, and meat alternatives 
being accepted by all major religions. However, New York was much more positive about meat alternatives being the future, but that meat 
alternatives will never be accepted but that it might have a place in the market. California agreed with all these aspects plus that it was only hype.

*Mindset 2*
There were even stronger polarizing views in Mindset 2.
New York and California both strongly agreed that meat replacements are not part of our culture, that it will only be popular in countries requiring 
protein but that it will be eventually part of our diet while only New York agreed it will bring cultural benefits. However, New York had opposite 
views regarding local traditions in that local farmers would lose their jobs, but that locally produced meat would be positive California disagreed 
with these points. California did agree that traditions should be changed to save the planet, but neither are had strong views on meat being part of 
the history and healthy lifestyle or meat free being accepted by most major religions. New York however, strongly disagreed with statements regarding 
the future, that meat alternatives are the future or that meat alternatives will ever be accepted or its only hype or that it might have a place in 
the market.  California only disagreed that it was only hype and not strongly about the other areas.
