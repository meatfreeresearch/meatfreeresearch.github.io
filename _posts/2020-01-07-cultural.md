title: Cultural and social aspects of meat alternatives
---

The results of the 3rd part of an eight part proprietary ground breaking market research study using Mind Genomics psychophysics 
into what excites or does not excite consumers emotionally in the emerging meat free "meat" market in the US focussed on the perceived 
impact on the Environment of consuming *“Non-Meat”* vs. regular meat. The sutdy was competed by 100 respondents from California and New York in Decemebr 2019.

*Overall top line on the Cultural and social aspects are that:*

Examining the results and insights gained across all areas researched was interesting and informative.

However, what stood out and is of major significance is the deeply divided Mindsets regarding the future of meat replacements which was consistent in both California and New York.

Major polarizations existed as to whether meat free alternatives have or indeed are the future or not and if they will be accepted or not. Even whether it is all hype and whether 
meat replacements would have a place in the market at all in the future.

What is clear is that any meat free replacement will have an easier time marketing to one Mindset of consumers versus another and that the message will have to be vastly different 
to appeal to one Mindset versus the other There are also other major ramifications on the future of meat replacements in the USA.
